## Hi there 👋

## Welcome to the GNOMATIX Repo Github Mirrors

These repos are being push-mirrored from a locally-hosted Gitea instance.

Most of these projects are "in-development", and "actively" being worked on by GNOMATIX's team of top-tier killbots.

"We're" using git-crypt in some cases here to protect some ideas that are maybe new; ideas are one of the few things we have left that we don't have to pay a monthly service fee to have access to.

(Although, I suppose from the perspective of a Corporation --- and don't forget, Corporations are people too --- that's not true.)

Anyhoo, these are some fun things I wanted to share; some fun ideas here. These are also essentially the products of iterating on an-indevelopment toolset that isn't fully represented here. Some of these projects started with a simple one-page README.md file, and were essentially implemented in a day. (In the normal half-assed "Agile" "fake it 'til you make it" way that "certain people" have been developing software since around ~2005, and which is clearly "baked into" the "mindset" of all "Frontier Models".)

README.md file to full-on project specs, issue tracking, wiki pages, project-specific SOPs informed by org-specific project docs; working prototype, web pages, pushed to public repo.

#### ...As of last week, in ***half a day***.

- 👏 Almost entirely using **open-source** and **free tools**.
  - [ 🛟 Production quality & easily deployable on consumer-grade hardware. ]
  - 
- 😮 Even the LLMs used could be **free** & **self-hosted**.
  - [ ✔️ "We've" *looked at that* !!! ]

### In Biology, which is foundational to life itself ... it's not the **size** of the tool. It's ***how you use it***.

[...but if you are into ***big tools***, be sure to check out our [***EELS***](https://github.com/gnomatix/eels)!!!]
